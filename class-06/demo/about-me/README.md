## The 4 phases to mastering anything:

### Phase 1 - unconscious incompetence.

This is the phase where you find something interesting and you want to know more.   You are unaware of how bad you are at it.

### Phase 2 - conscious incompetence.

This is the phase where you start to learn something and you realize you are really bad at it.  You may feel really dumb or like there is a ton of work to do to get good at something.

### Phase 3 - conscious competence.

You are getting better at that thing and are consciously thinking about what you are doing and how to be better at it.

### Phase 4 - unconscious competence.

You are so good at something that you don't have to think about it, it now feels like a part of you.
